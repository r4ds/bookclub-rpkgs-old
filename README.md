# R4DS R Packages Book Club

A weekly reading group of [R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) (2nd ed, WIP). Over the course of this book club, each member is going to start their own package!

Visit the [#bookclub-r_packages channel](https://r4ds.io/join) on Slack to join the video chat! 

This repo contains 2 main folders:

- Presentations: each week a presenter will give a talk summarizing the chapter(s) and/or discussing practical applications of the topic at hand. 
- Companion: A (WIP) [Bookdown site](https://r4ds.github.io/bookclub-rpkgs/Companion/introduction.html) outlining **learning objectives** and **collecting questions and answers** on the chapters that come up during meetings (or between!)

Other useful links:

- CRAN's [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)
- Book Club repo navigation: [GitHub Web Editor](https://youtu.be/d41oc2OMAuI) | [GitHub Local Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNUNPkoledI)
