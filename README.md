# R4DS R Packages Book Club

A weekly reading group of [R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) (2nd ed, WIP). Over the course of this book club, each member is going to start their own package!

Visit the [#bookclub-r_packages channel](https://r4ds.io/join) on Slack to join the video chat! 

This repo contains 2 main folders:

- Presentations: each week a presenter will give a talk summarizing the chapter and/or discussing practical applications of the topic at hand. 
- Companion: A working document outlining **learning objectives** and collecting questions (and answers) on the chapters that come up during meetings (or between!)
