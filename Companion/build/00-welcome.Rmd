# Welcome {-}

This book is a companion to [R Packages, 2nd ed (WIP)](https://r-pkgs.org/), by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan, and aims to support the reader through a full read-through of the book. It sets out learning objectives as well as collects common questions and answers.

This Companion is also a work in progress, and being compiled alongside the first cohort(s) of the R4DS R Packages Book Club. Recordings for the accompanying presentations can be seen on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3x6DOfs2NGiXMln8bxY7e0XgA5z1cp-8).

## Suggested Order {-}

We believe there is a different (idea-based) order in which this book should be read if reading every chapter (for example, by a book club) and our first cohort of the book club will be [following the order described here](introduction.html)!
