# `DESCRIPTION`

- Every package must include a `DESCRIPTION` file (written using Debian control format (DCF)).

- Use `usethis::create_package("badpkg")` to create a package.

```
Package: badpkg
Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case)
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R (parsed):
    * First Last <first.last@example.com> [aut, cre] (YOUR-ORCID-ID)
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to
    pick a license
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.1
```

---

# `DESCRIPTION`

- Use `usethis::create_package("badpkg")` with [`usethis.*` options set](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#store-default-values-for-description-fields-and-other-preferences-1).

```
Title: R package for {{...}}.
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Tony",
           family = "ElHabr",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "me@gmail.com")
Description: An R package for {{...}}.
License: MIT + file LICENSE
```

global `.Rprofile`

```
usethis.description = list(
  Title = 'R package for {{...}}.',
  Description = 'An R package for {{...}}.',
  `Authors@R` = 'person("Tony", "ElHabr", email = "me@gmail.com", 
    role = c("aut", "cre")
  )',
  License = 'MIT + file LICENSE',
  Version = '0.0.0.9000'
)
```

# `Title` and `Description`

- `Title`: one-liner
- `Description`: more detailed

```
Package: badpkg
Title: R package full of bad practices.
Description: An R package to exemplify how one can be a bad dev yet still learn
    how to write an R package.
```

# `Author@R`

- Should include name, email address, and role for each author.

```
Authors@R: c(
    person("Hadley", "Wickham", email = "hadley@rstudio.com", role = "cre"),
    person("Winston", "Chang", email = "winston@rstudio.com", role = "aut")
)
```

- Most common roles
  - `cre`: creator or maintainer
  - `aut`: authors
  - `ctb`: contributors
  - `cph`: copyright holder
  
```{r echo=F, include=T, eval=T, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/tools-xkcd.png')
```

---

# `URL` and `BugReports`

- `URL` and `BugReports` list other resources available for help.
  - `BugReports` is often the issues page in the GitHub package repo.
  - Most commonly, `URL` points to the GitHub repo or a `{pkgdown}` site.

```{r echo=F, include=T, eval=T, out.width='40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/fixing_problems-xkcd.png')
```

---

# `Version`

- Released packages: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
  - e.g. 1.2.3 = Major version 1, minor version 2, patch 3
- In-development packages: `0.0.0.9000`
- Use `usethis::use_version()` to increment version.

```{r echo=F, include=T, eval=T, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/software_updates-xkcd.png')
```

---

# Dependencies

- `Imports`
  - Lists packages that must be present for your package to work.
  - Packages will be installed if not already installed.
  - Best practice is to namespace functions (i.e. `package::function()`) internally, although not strictly necessary.
- `Suggests`
  - Lists packages that are used, but not required (i.e. for tests and vignettes).
  - Packages will not be installed if not already installed.
  - Best practice is to use `requireNamespace()`.
  
- Use `usethis::use_package()` to add packages to `Imports` and `Suggests`.

---

# Dependencies

- Best practice is to specify minimum versions of packages and R.

```
Depends: 
    R (>= 3.4.0)
Imports:
    ggplot2 (>= 3.0.0),
    dplyr (>= 1.0.0)
Suggests:
    testthat (>= 3.0.0)
```

- `LinkingTo`, `Enhances`, and `SystemRequirements` exist for specific reasons.

---

# `License`

- 2 broad categories:
  - Permissive
      - ~15% of R CRAN packages per Hadley, and ~55% of GitHub packages found [by a 2015 survey](https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/).
  - Copyleft
      - ~70% of R CRAN packages, but only ~20% of GitHub packages.
- 3 recommended licenses for R devs: (1) `MIT`, (2)`GPL-2` or `GPL-3`, (3) `CC0`
- Important if planning to release your package.
- Required for CRAN.
- 3 locations where license is recorded:
  - `License` field in `DESCRIPTION` file
      - e.g. `GPL (>= 2)`, `GPL-2`, `MIT + file`, `file LICENSE`
  - `LICENSE` file
  - `LICENSE.md` file (copy of the full text of the license)
      - Should not go on CRAN.
- If using external code, ensure compliance with other code's license
  - `LICENSE.note` may be appropriate.
- Easy to create with `usethis::use_*_license()`.

---

# Licenses

Licenses, from most to least permissive:

- `MIT`
  - Simple and permissive.
  - Others can freely use your code as long as they distribute the same license with their code.
  - Actually a "template" that points to another file, hence `MIT + file`
- `Apache`
  - Similar to the MIT license but it also includes an explicit patent grant.
- GNU Lesser General Public License (`LGPL`)
  - Mostly like `GPL`.
- GNU General Public License (`GPL-2` and `GPL-3`)
  - Stricter than `MIT`.
  - Those who use your code and distribute it must also make the source available.
  - `GPL-3` covers up for some "loopholes" in `GPL-2`.
- Affero General Public License (`AGPL`)
  - Defines "distribution" more strictly, such that it includes providing a service over a network.

---

# Licenses for data packages

Licenses for data packages, from most to least permissive:

- Creative Commons (`CC0`):
  - Most appropriate for data packages.
- `CC-BY`:
  - Like `CC0`, but author must be credited.

```{r echo=F, include=T, eval=T, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/colombus.jpg')
```

---

# Other licensing things

- Re-licensing
  - Must check with all contributors!
- Copyright holder
- Code given to you
  - Implicitly agreeing to your license.
  - Best practice is to acknowledge contributors somewhere.
- Common cases when bundling external code:
  1. Do nothing if (1) your license is same as external or if (2) external license is MIT or BSD.
  3. If external license is more restrictive, (1) make your license more restrictive, (2) find external code that uses a more permissive license, or (3) put the external code in a separate package.
