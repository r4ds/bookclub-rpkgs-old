# Why write a package?

> "Seriously, it doesn’t have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time."
> — Hillary Parker

- Share code with others (easy download, install, and use)
- Opinionated organization; you don't have to think about it
- Standardized tools (usethis/devtools/goodpractice)

---

# Metapackages

> "Anything that can be automated, should be automated."

- devtools: Meta-meta-package that loads all the tidyverse team metapackages.
- usethis: Go through the function list on this to make your life easier.
- goodpractice: Not mentioned in the book but I find it super helpful for catching all the things.
- styler: Enforce style so you don't have to.
